Today we will try to add a header to our site using the Minimal Mistakes theme. The header can include an image,
overlay color, and actions like buttons.

## Configuration

The header image can be configured in the front matter of your page or post. Here is an example of how to set it up:

```yaml
title: "Adding a Header to the Site"
date: 2025-06-21T09:11:00-04:00
header:
  image: /assets/images/bio-photo.jpg
```
More configurations and additional options can be found in the  [Minimal Mistakes documentation].
