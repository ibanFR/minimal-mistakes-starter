This is a quick start guide to help you get up and running with the [Minimal Mistakes] theme.

When you first start your Jekyll site, you will have a default layout and some sample content. This guide will help you understand how to customize your site and make it your own.

## Home

The home page is the first page that visitors see when they visit your site.

By default, the home page is set to display a list of your latest posts. You can change this by modifying the `index.html` file in the root directory of your Jekyll site.

Update [home.md](/_pages/home.md) to customize the content of your home page. You can add text, images, and links to other pages on your site.

## Posts
You probably want to delete the sample posts that come with the theme. You can do this by deleting the files in the `_posts` directory.

## Navigation
The [Navigation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/navigation/) menu is located in the `_data/navigation.yml` file. You can add, remove, or modify the links in this 
file to customize the navigation menu on your site.

## Pages
documentation to understand how to create and manage pages. The Minimal Mistakes theme provides a variety of layouts and includes support for custom collections, which can be used to create different types of content.
