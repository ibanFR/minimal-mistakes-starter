I'm a passionate Software Engineer with over 17 years of hands-on experience in software development, specializing in
Software Architecture, Behavior Driven Development (BDD), Domain Driven Design (DDD), Test Driven Development (TDD) and
Continuous Delivery.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to shape and drive impactful software solutions. My expertise lies in
leveraging the Java EE tech stack to architect and deliver robust, scalable software systems that meet business 
objectives
and exceed client expectations.

I'm deeply committed to fostering an environment of continuous learning and creative thinking, where teams can innovate
and explore new possibilities within the Java ecosystem. I believe in empowering individuals to unleash their full
potential and achieve collective success.
